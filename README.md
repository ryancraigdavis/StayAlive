## StayAlive
StayAlive monitors the combat log and allows raid members and raid leaders to see who is or isn't using their defensives. This tool will monitor defensive use, self-healing spells, and items such as health stones.

The purpose of this tool is to help raiders realize when and how they should be using their defensives.

## Commands
Use `/stayalive` to see the available commands:

`/stayalive start` will turn on combat logging and begin watching for defensives in the raid.
Use `/stayalive broadcast` at the end of a fight to broadcast to the raid who did and did not use their defensives
Use `/stayalive message` at the end of a fight to message to raiders their defensive use
